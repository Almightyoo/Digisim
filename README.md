The code is written in a very adaptable.
This project is a very versatile digital electronics simulator. It can simulates complex circuits and the code can handle a wide range of digital circuits, from basic gates to intricate designs. It is specifically designed such that it can handle complicated connections using script communication between gates. It can handle any number of gates, the script communication logic allows complex connections of digital gates.
